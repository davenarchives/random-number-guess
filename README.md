# Number Guessing Game

A simple, interactive number guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic number guessing game. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it in as few attempts as possible. After each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.

## Features

- Random number generation between 1 and 100
- Input validation to ensure guesses are within the valid range
- Feedback on each guess (too high, too low, or correct)
- Attempt counter to track the number of guesses
- Option to play again after correctly guessing the number

## Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Extract the files (if downloaded as ZIP) to your desired location.
3. Open the \`index.html\` file in a web browser.

No additional setup or installation is required as this game runs entirely in the browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

5. The game will provide feedback on whether your guess was too high, too low, or correct.
6. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.
7. Once you've guessed correctly, you can click the "Play Again" button to start a new game.
